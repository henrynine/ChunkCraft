ChunkCraft is a Minecraft-inspired 2D game that runs in a terminal emulator. Players can explore, build, craft, and hunt.

**Features**

* Procedurally generated map with trees, pigs, rocks, and ponds
* Crafting system with recipes
* Furnaces to smelt iron ore and cook pork chops
* Doors that can be opened and closed

**Controls**

* wasd to move (if you can't move past the edge of a chunk, either you've reached the edge of the map or there's an obstacle on the other side)
* m to enter mining mode (mining iron requires a stone or iron pick)
* i to view inventory
* c to craft
* e to enter interactive mode (for doors and furnaces)
* p to enter placement mode (whatever block you have equipped will be placed)

**Colors**

For optimal graphics, make the following color display changes in your terminal emulator's settings:

* yellow -> brown
* cyan -> gray
* magenta -> pink
* red -> burnt orange
