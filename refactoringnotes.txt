* get inventory manipulation and ui code out of blocks
* don't ever do manual inventory manipulation, also fix to respect cap
* make list of playtests and unit tests to run before and after
* add documentation to all record definitions and functions in *.mli
* consider set list question again but even though this is clunk it
  probably does make the most sense
* should add to set list take a max? should set lists themselves have 
  a max?
* probably remove commented out code

* candidate files:
  * blocks.ml
  * display.ml

* next features to add:
  * health
  * eating
  * hostile entities
  * underground section for mining?
